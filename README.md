### Game Overview

In this game, players will move through linear levels defeating different dragon enemies to
obtain drops and currency. Players will be able to collect gold from slain dragons, as well as a
variety of weapons that they’re able to use in their next battle with a dragon. Each level will
contain at least 2 different dragons, and dragon difficulty increases with each level.
The dragon enemies will feature at least 2 different attack styles which they use to attack the
player. Once all dragons have been defeated on a level, the player will automatically progress to
the next level and fight new dragon enemies.
